# Predict Transparent Semiconductors using Machine Learning
Transparent semiconductors may be the future for flat panel display!<br>

So what determine the transparency of the semiconductor? <br>
Short answer: the band gap. <br>
Then what determine the stability of the transparent semiconductor? <br>
Again, short answer: the formation energy. <br>

This [kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nomad2018-predict-transparent-conductors/) predicts the band gap and the formation energy of 600 semiconductors, given structural properties of 2400 semiconductors as the training set.

Results:
