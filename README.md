# Predict Transparent Semiconductors using Machine Learning
Transparent semiconductors may be the future for flat panel display!<br>

So what determine the transparency of the semiconductors? <br>
Short answer: The band gap. <br>
Then what determine the stability of the transparent semiconductors? <br>
Short answer: The formation energy. <br>

This [kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nomad2018-predict-transparent-conductors/) predicts the band gap and the formation energy of 600 semiconductors, given structural properties of 2400 semiconductors as the training set.

Results: <br>
Accuracy = 94.2 % <br>

For machine learning, head over to [ml.ipynb](ml.ipynb) (since this competition is still ongoing, I'll post my code once it is over). <br>
